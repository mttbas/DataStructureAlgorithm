    /*
    WIKI:
    Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes
    the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
    In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to
    how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
     */
     /*
     the underlying concepts are not that hard:
     we USE BIG O NOTATION to describe the PERFORMANCE OF AN ALGORITHM. it helps us to know if a given ALGORITHM
     is scalable or not. that is: is this ALGORITHM going to scale well as the INPUT grows really LARGE????
     so
     just because your code executes quickly does not mean it is going
     to perform well when you give it a LARGE DATA SET. that is why we USE O(N)
     to describe the performance of an Algorithm

     what does this have to do with DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM?
     we will learn that certain OPERATION can be less or more costly depending on what DATA STRUCTURE WE USE.
     eg: accessing an ARRAY ELEMENT BY ITS INDEX is super fast. BUT
     ARRAYS HAVE a FIXED LENGTH AND IF YOU WANNA CONSTANTLY ADD OR REMOVE items from them
     they have to get resized. and it will get costly as the size of our INPUT GROWS LARGE.

     so
     if that is what we need to do: THEN WE HAVE TO USE ANOTHER DATA STRUCTURE CALLED: a LINKED LIST
     these data structures can grow or shrink vey quickly BUT accessing a LINKED LIST ELEMENT BY ITS INDEX
     is slow.

     THAT IS WHY YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE BIG O NOTATION FIRST before we talk about the various DATA STRUCTURES

     in JOB INTERVIEWS the ask you about BIG O and DATA STRUCTURE OR ALGORITHM.
